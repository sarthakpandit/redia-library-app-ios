## Building

All needed 3rd party code and libraries are automatically included as 
subrepos to this library.

You need to configure the prefix file macros by editing
the file library-app-ios/redia_library_app_config.h
and inserting URLs to relevant backends.

The XCode project named library-app-ios/redia-library-app.xcodeproj
should be able to build as-is.
